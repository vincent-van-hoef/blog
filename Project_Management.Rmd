## Page setup

How to set up this page?

This page is renderedu using a minimal docker container, so you have to use a specific parameter (`dev = "svglite"` in the code block definition) to display Cairo graphs.

```{r , dev = "svglite", echo = TRUE}
plot(1:10)
```

## R workflow using {Targets}

The official Targets documentation can be found [here](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/){target="blank"}.

## Tips

- Create figures in PDF or TIFF so they can be manually edited later! This might be faster for small tweaks of specific plots...
